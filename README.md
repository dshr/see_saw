=======

A Web Audio API step sequencer, a project for a university module.

Authors/Contributions:
 
- [Panagiotis Baralidis](https://github.com/panbar) - FX Chain and FX Interface
- [James Woodbridge](https://github.com/james-woodbridge) - Overall Interface work
- [Desislav Hristov](https://github.com/dshr) - Sequencer, Instruments, Instruments Interface, Import/Export and initial FX Chain work

We first used Mercurial for version control, and only then decided to host it on github, so we lost all commit history.

Right now we're deciding on a new name (seeSAW is already taken).

You can try it out by visiting [https://dshr.github.io/see_saw](dshr.github.io/see_saw) or you can run it on a local http server like this:

- get Python
- open Terminal
- `cd` into seeSAW directory
- run `python -m SimplHTTPServer`
- then you can access the site at http://0.0.0.0:8000/

P.S.
CSS is stil a bit rough though, may work strangely on smaller screens.
