see_saw
=======

A Web Audio API step sequencer, a project for a university module.

Authors: [Panagiotis Baralidis](https://github.com/panbar), [James Woodbridge](mailto:james@cynomusic.com) and [Desislav Hristov](https://github.com/dshr).

Right now we're deciding on a new name (seeSAW is already taken) and as soon as we do that we'll host this project on github pages.
Until then you'll have to download it and run it in a webserver to try it. 

The easiest way to do that is:
- get Python
- open Terminal
- `cd` into seeSAW directory
- run `python -m SimplHTTPServer`
- then you can access the site at http://0.0.0.0:8000/

P.S.
CSS is stil a bit rough though, may work strangely on smaller screens.
